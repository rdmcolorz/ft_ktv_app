#ft_ktv web app
For our school karaoke event, I spent two days hacking up this song queueing web app that takes songs from students and queues them up in a dashboard so people don't have to fight over who sings first and for easier tracking of song lists.

I used firebase as backend to handle the signup and authentication, Vue.js as frontend to showcase the embedded Youtube video and queue of songs.

System works so you can queue songs and dequeue them if you made a mistake. Only the admin has access to the youtube embedded video to show over the projector.

I love karaoke, and helped host a few events where we just used slack to handle the song links, which was a mess. I self-taught Vue.js recently and thought this was a perfect time to solve a relevant problem using my skills. In the end, although there were some bugs relating to the youtube api, but I really had fun watching people use my app and getting feedback.
